# Build-a-News-Site - ART GUIDE STHLM

As a part of the web bootcamp at Technigo, the project brief was to create a news site with the following goals:
- Style your page.
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to layout the page.
- Create a responsive design with the following views: Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column (make it look good on devices from 320px width up to 1600px).
- Include the following elements:
  header, 
  a main news article, 
  a grid of smaller news articles, 
- Follow our guidelines on how to write clean code
- Deploy your page to Netlify and add it to the Readme file of the repository

I decided to make a news site for art exhibitions in Stockholm. 
At first I made a sketch on paper to decide what the website should include and the layout.
After that I began to explore how the visual identity of the site should be. I decide to go for a quiet clean, yet fun aesthetic.
To help myself while coding for different devices, I made each media query into a different colour scheme, which I ended up liking and keeping.
I used the reference library at W3schools for HTML and CSS, as well as search online if I didn't find what I needed. When the websites felt ready enough, I decided to get ai-codefeedback to further improve my code, which resulted in minor tweaks, no major changes. It was good to get some feedback on how to simplify and shorten the code, like if several containers have the same rules I can write it in one section rather than several.

If I hade more time, I would include a map of Stockholm so it's possible to get an overview of different locations in the city. I began to include that, found the write code etc to add it but decided not to include it as I didn't find a good spot to place it on the website. With more time, I would like included that. I would also make some adjustments for wider screens than 1600px.
